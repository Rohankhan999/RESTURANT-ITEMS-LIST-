        <P>Kheer is a traditional South Asian dessert, particularly popular in Pakistan, made from rice, milk, and
            sugar. This rice pudding is rich, creamy, and fragrant, often flavored with aromatic spices like cardamom
            and garnished with nuts such as almonds and pistachios. Sometimes, saffron is added, lending a beautiful
            golden hue and a unique flavor to the dish.

            The preparation of kheer involves simmering rice and milk together over low heat until the mixture thickens,
            allowing the rice to absorb the milk and sugar fully. This slow-cooking process gives kheer its distinctive,
            luscious texture. It can be served hot or chilled, making it a versatile dessert suitable for various
            occasions and seasons.

            Kheer is often prepared during festive occasions, religious celebrations, and family gatherings in Pakistan.
            Its roots trace back to ancient times, and it holds cultural significance, symbolizing prosperity and joy.
            Variations of kheer include the addition of vermicelli (seviyan kheer) or tapioca pearls (sabudana kheer),
            each adding a different texture and flavor to the traditional recipe.

            This dessert is cherished not only for its delightful taste but also for the warmth and comfort it brings,
            embodying the essence of Pakistani hospitality and culinary tradition.</P>
