    <p><B>Pizza fries combine the best of both worlds: the comforting indulgence of pizza and the crispy satisfaction of
            fries. This innovative dish starts with a base of golden, crispy fries, perfectly seasoned to complement the
            bold flavors to come. On top of this foundation, a generous layer of melted mozzarella cheese blankets the
            fries, creating a gooey, stretchy layer that binds the toppings together.

            Next comes the heart of the dish: savory pizza toppings. Traditional marinara sauce, rich with tomatoes and
            herbs, is spooned generously over the cheesy fries, imparting a tangy sweetness that harmonizes with the
            saltiness of the cheese. Slices of pepperoni, spicy sausage, or other favorite pizza toppings are scattered
            across the surface, adding bursts of flavor and texture to each bite. For those who prefer a vegetarian
            option, mushrooms, bell peppers, and olives can be delightful alternatives.

            Once assembled, the entire dish is baked until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned, ensuring that each
            forkful or bite-sized portion delivers a satisfying crunch and a burst of pizza-inspired taste. Pizza fries
            are not just a meal; they're an experienceâ€”a perfect union of two beloved comfort foods that brings joy to
            casual diners and food enthusiasts alike.</B></p>
