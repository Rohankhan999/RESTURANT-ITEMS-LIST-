<P><B>Mutton Karahi is a beloved Pakistani dish known for its rich and aromatic flavors. This traditional curry is made
        with tender pieces of mutton cooked in a wok, which is referred to as "karahi" in Urdu. The dish begins with the
        frying of onions, garlic, and ginger in ghee or oil, creating a savory base. Fresh tomatoes are then added,
        along with a blend of spices including cumin, coriander, and red chili powder. The mutton is simmered in this
        fragrant mixture until it becomes succulent and imbued with the complex flavors of the spices. Green chilies and
        fresh coriander are added towards the end to enhance the dish's aroma and give it a final burst of freshness.
        Mutton Karahi is typically served with naan or steamed rice, allowing the rich, spicy gravy to be soaked up
        beautifully. This dish is not only a staple in Pakistani households but also a highlight in many South Asian
        restaurants around the world. Its hearty and robust taste, combined with the tender meat and thick gravy, makes
        Mutton Karahi a favorite for festive occasions and everyday meals alike, embodying the rich culinary heritage of
        Pakistan.</B></P>
